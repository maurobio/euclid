A simple Android app for calculating the areas of geometric shapes.

This app demonstrates a number of features of [Lazarus Android Module Wizard](https://github.com/jmpessoa/lazandroidmodulewizard). Its aim is to serve as a testbed for learning and practicing the development of relatively simple Android apps in Free Pascal.

Of course, it can also be used for learning some basic principles of Euclidean geometry, by demonstrating how to calculate the areas of several geometric shapes!
