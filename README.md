A simple Android app for calculating the areas of geometric shapes.

This app demonstrates a number of features of [Lazarus Android Module Wizard](https://github.com/jmpessoa/lazandroidmodulewizard) (LAMW). Its aim is to serve as a testbed for learning and practicing the development of relatively simple Android apps in Free Pascal.

The following LAMW components are used in this app:

- jScrollView

- jLinearLayout

- jSpinner

- jImageList

- jImageView

- jEditText

- jButton

- jTextView

Of course, it can also be used for learning some basic principles of Euclidean geometry, by demonstrating how to calculate the areas of several geometric shapes!
